## Data sources
Stage 1: 
- Data set was initially randomly seeded from a fictitious data set (approximately 10,000 records per DB table), then consistently associated with that seeding. 
- Data set includes a substantial amount of "dirty data" (bad data), which had to be filtered prior to use. 
Stage 2: 
- ONLY for Product Overview: Using the legacy data set (mentioned above) Project Deimos sanitized the data and extended the data, generating approximately 60,0000,000 records in five database tables.
- The Stage 1 data set is still used for: Related Products, Questions & Answers, and Reviews. QQQ
